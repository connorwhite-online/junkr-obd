# Research: Toyota K-Line/DLC3 Libraries and Implementations

## Research Goals

1. Find existing libraries for Toyota K-Line/DLC3 communication
2. Check if ESP32 implementations exist
3. Verify if anyone has successfully read from 1KZ-TE or similar Toyota ECUs
4. Identify what's actually available vs what needs to be built

## Libraries to Research

### 1. OBD9141 Library
- **What:** Arduino library for ISO 9141 K-Line protocol
- **Status:** Need to verify existence and ESP32 compatibility
- **Source:** Should be in Arduino Library Manager or GitHub

### 2. TechStream Lite
- **What:** Open-source Toyota diagnostic software
- **Status:** Need to find source code and see if portable to ESP32
- **Source:** GitHub or similar

### 3. ESP32 K-Line Projects
- **What:** Any existing ESP32 implementations
- **Status:** Search GitHub, forums, etc.

### 4. Toyota-Specific Projects
- **What:** Projects specifically for Toyota vehicles
- **Status:** Search for 1KZ-TE, Land Cruiser, Toyota diagnostic projects
