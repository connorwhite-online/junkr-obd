## 💡 Money-Saving Tips

### 1. **Buy Generic Clones**
- Amazon "ADS1115" modules work fine ($7 vs $12 Adafruit)
- Savings: $10-15

### 2. **Use Weatherpack Instead of Deutsch**
- Still sealed, just less premium
- Savings: $10

### 3. **Order PCBs as Group**
- JLCPCB minimum is 5 boards
- Offer extras to friends or sell on forums
- Effective cost: $5 per board instead of $10

### 4. **Wait for Sales**
- Adafruit often has 15% off sales
- Amazon Prime Day deals on tools
- Black Friday electronics sales

### 5. **Buy Assortment Kits**
- Resistor/capacitor kits ($10 for 500+ pieces)
- Better value than individual components
- Useful for future projects

### 6. **Use Existing Wire**
- Old ethernet cable works for signals (not power!)
- Old USB cables work (has 4 conductors)
- Savings: $10-15

2. **From Amazon:** Enclosure, connectors, hardware (Prime = 2 days)
3. **From AliExpress:** Budget wire, terminals (if not urgent)

### Week 2: Order Tools (if needed)
1. **Essential tools first:** Soldering iron, solder, multimeter
2. **Nice-to-have later:** Crimper, heat gun

### Week 3: (Optional) Order Custom PCB
1. **Upload to JLCPCB:** Use provided Gerber files
2. **Order components from Digi-Key:** SMD parts
3. **Wait 1-2 weeks for PCB arrival**

### Build Day (Week 4)
1. Assemble module
2. Test on bench
3. Install in vehicle
